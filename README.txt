CATCH THE MOUSE INTERACTIVE GAME

Note that this game was inspired from a past assignment which was never finished and now was completed with chatGPT, and improved.

Catch the Mouse is a click, interactive Java game where the player tries to catch a red mouse (touch the red mouse) while avoiding green snakes. The game is played on a grid-based board, of a size set by the user.


How to Run the Game
1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository containing the game files and classes.
3. Open the project/repository that you have downloaded, in an IDE.
4. Navigate to the class titled "Main" and run this file to startup the game.
5. Play the game by touching open (grey) tiles to turn them green, when the mouse comes near one of your selected green tiles, touch the snake to win the game.
6. If you have gotten an unfavourable randomized situation of the game, hit the "restart" button to get a new randomized game. You can also hit the "quit" window to delete the game window and take you back to the IDE. 
7. To customize your game experience, one can go back to the IDE, go to the "Main" class file, then edit the size of the gameboard to whatever they want (this is the rows of the board for the game experience).


Have fun, and catch that mouse!!!
